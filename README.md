# Daily-planner-app
Challenge 7 for Bootcamp in front-end web development and Ux

This marks the seventh challenge within the University of Birmingham bootcamp focused on front-end web development and UX.
In this challenge, i had to create a basic calendar app where users can save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and uses dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I also included the Day.js library to handle date and time operations. 

Realistically, I was able to get the app setup to a large extent. However, along the line i broke the codes when refactoring it and was trying to troubleshoot it to correct the bug but because of time i haven't finished it completely. I have also not finished with getting it to run all the task smoothly which i am still working on. ALso, I need to use a local storage on the app.

# Requirements


Criteria for successful completition of this challenge were:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Show time blocks aligned with regular business hours while the user scrolls downward.
 
* Assign distinct colors to each time block indicating whether it pertains to the past, present, or future when viewed.
 
* Permit users to input an event by clicking on a time block.

* Store the event in local storage upon clicking the save button within that time block.


This challenge gave me a little problem initially, as i had to introduce jquery in my work, but i did some research which buily my confidence a bit. Moreover, I will still need to refactor my codes to make it work perfectly with the third party APIs.


## Usage
The app is not perfectly done yet but I hope to do just a few tweaks and get it rolling.
